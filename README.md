# WaveFunctionGridmap

This is an experiment I put together in Godot Game Engine inspired by and based in part on the incredible work by Martin Donald in his youtube video **Superpositions, Sudoku, the Wave Function Collapse algorithm.** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2SuvO4Gi7uY

This project attempts to use the built in GridMap inside the Godot Game engine to generate the WaveFuntionCollapse ruleset. The algorithm run under the assumption that anything that you have built in the chosen GridMap represents a valid combination of cells, it then attempts to use a simple set of logical comparison and contraints to increase the flexiblity of potentional results while avoid invalid results.

In theory a GridMap layout then generated by the algorithm could then itself by used as a ruleset for subsequent generation, with or without further alteration.
